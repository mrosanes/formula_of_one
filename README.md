Equation of summation equal one: formula found by Marc Rosanes after a trip to France

Marc Rosanes Siscart equation of one (formula of one),
in form of script.

This equation derives to a trip to France that happened at 
some point between years 2013-2015, and in which we though about
the problem of a 'french' digicode, where some numbers of the 
keypad were worn. After finding a demonstration of the code formula, I got
to the 'formula of one' by chance.

I publish it here under the github project:
